# minesweeper

A simplified version of the game Minesweeper played in the CLI
Currently the game is locked to 10 mines in a 10x10 grid with no ability to flag a square 

To win: reveal all squares that do not have a mine
To lose: reveal a mine 

To do
- Add ability to flag a square 
- Allow for the user to configure number of mines and grid size
- Keep track of win/losses
- An empty square should reveal all squares around it, and cascade into other nearby empty squares
